## Command Injection Methods
## To inject an additional command to the intended one, we may use any of the following operators:

##  Injection Operator	Injection Character	URL-Encoded Character	Executed Command

```Semicolon	      ;	         %3b	      Both```

```New Line	      \n         %0a	      Both```
