## TheHarvester
TheHarvester is a simple-to-use yet powerful and effective tool for early-stage penetration testing and red team engagements. We can use it to gather information to help identify a company's attack surface. The tool collects emails, names, subdomains, IP addresses, and URLs from various public data sources for passive information gathering. For now, we will use the following modules:

``` Baidu	Baidu search engine. ```
Bufferoverun	Uses data from Rapid7's Project Sonar - www.rapid7.com/research/project-sonar/
Crtsh	Comodo Certificate search.
Hackertarget	Online vulnerability scanners and network intelligence to help organizations.
Otx	AlienVault Open Threat Exchange - https://otx.alienvault.com
Rapiddns	DNS query tool, which makes querying subdomains or sites using the same IP easy.
Sublist3r	Fast subdomains enumeration tool for penetration testers
Threatcrowd	Open source threat intelligence.
Threatminer	Data mining for threat intelligence.
Trello	Search Trello boards (Uses Google search)
Urlscan	A sandbox for the web that is a URL and website scanner.
Vhost	Bing virtual hosts search.
Virustotal	Domain search.
Zoomeye	A Chinese version of Shodan.
To automate this, we will create a file called sources.txt with the following contents.
